#
# Used by GitHub Actions cleanup jobs to keep specific versions/tags for npm and Docker
# (see assets/ci_cleanup_npm_package.js and assets/ci_cleanup_docker_images.js).
# One rule per line:
# - exact: 1.2.3
# - wildcard *: 1.* or v2.* (matches the full string)
# - exclude: !1.2.3 or !1.* (allow cleanup to remove those; keep wins if both match)
# - # comments and blank lines are ignored
#
# Examples:
# 2.*        # keep all 2.x
# !2.0.0     # allow cleanup of 2.0.0
# v1.*       # keep v1 Docker tags
#
